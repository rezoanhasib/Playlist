# Playlist
An ADT that represents a playlist of audio files similar to the ones used by audio playback programs such as iTunes and Windows Media Player.
This ADT will be responsible for maintaining simple information about each audio file (namely the title, artist, and length in minutes and seconds).
This ADT is also responsible for the correct ordering of the audio files in the list.
This ADT provides a series of operations for manipulating the playlist including adding and removing audio files, displaying the contents of the list, 
and finding all songs that were performed by a particular artist.
